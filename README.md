# rally-clone-game
This is a personal exercise in game development. The main goal is to produce a port of arcade game Rally.

Please check `.circleci/config.yml` for dependencies necessary.

The design of this application allows easy substitution of players and UI.

The main logic of the game is in game::CController.

The board logic is in board::CBoard.
